Hey.
I don't know if anybody reads these. I try to do cool stuff with cool tech. I co-founded a weekly Hackathon on Wednesday nights to help people with motivation with their projects and generally try to do good in the world. 
Perhaps I'll write more later, but for now, I'm just doing this because one of my friends in particular likes for me to use Github. So there's that.
